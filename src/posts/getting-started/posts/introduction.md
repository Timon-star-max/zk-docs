**ZKML** Protocol is a non-custodial solution that uses stealth addresses to enable users to send and receive XRP on the XRP EVM compatible chain without revealing the receiver's real address; which serves as their identity on the blockchain.

## Project Overview

Have you ever wished you could send and receive funds without anyone snooping around your business? Well, say hello to Zkml Protocol – your privacy guardian on the XRP EVM compatible chain.

We’re tackling the issue of exposing personal info during transactions by introducing stealth addresses.

- The project draws inspiration from existing privacy-focused blockchains like Monero and tools like Tornado Cash but aims to bridge the gap between complex and expensive privacy solutions and non-private transfers.

- It empowers users to maintain their privacy, fostering trust and security in the blockchain industry.

## Background
- Issue Addressed: Zkml Protocol addresses the pressing concern of inadequate privacy in blockchain transactions. While the blockchain guarantees transparency and immutability, it simultaneously exposes sensitive details of transactions, such as sender and recipient addresses. This lack of privacy imposes significant risks on both individuals and businesses, potentially connecting their financial actions to real-world identities.

- Fundamental Privacy: Privacy holds a crucial role in financial transactions. Without a robust privacy layer, users remain vulnerable to an array of risks:

- Identity Exposure: Open blockchain transactions create an avenue for observers to correlate transactions with specific people or entities. This jeopardizes financial privacy and exposes individuals to potential targeting or surveillance.

  * Financial Profiling: In-depth profiling of individuals and businesses becomes possible through the analysis of blockchain transactions. This includes identifying spending habits, income sources, and financial associations. Such data can be exploited for targeted ads, discrimination, or even extortion.

  * Business Exposure: Transparent transactions inadvertently reveal confidential financial information of companies, like sales figures, supply chain connections, and partnerships. Competitors can leverage this intel to gain an edge, potentially undermining business competitiveness.

* Regulatory Hurdles: Certain industries, such as healthcare and finance, mandate stringent privacy regulations. Transparent blockchain transactions could clash with these standards, resulting in legal complications or penalties for non-compliance.
